        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I was born on May 9th 2011 in Cincinnati Ohio. I was born with weak muscles and was very very cute.
            <br>
            I started taking meds when i was only four, however I was born smarter than usual, especially in math and was very very curious about it. I actually started getting great in swimming when I was 7 and I am now 10 years old. Other interests of mine include space, weather, and coding.
